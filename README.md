# Audio-Based Music Recommender

An intelligent music recommendation system that analyzes the actual sound characteristics of songs to suggest similar tracks, rather than relying solely on metadata or collaborative filtering.

## Project Overview

This system extracts audio embeddings from songs using pre-trained deep learning models and recommends music based on acoustic similarity. The project demonstrates content-based recommendation systems, audio signal processing, and machine learning evaluation techniques.

## Features

- Audio-based similarity using deep learning embeddings
- Spotify API integration for live music data
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics (precision@k, diversity, novelty)
- Web interface for interactive recommendations
- Hybrid approach combining audio features with metadata

## Tech Stack

- **Audio Processing**: librosa, OpenL3
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn, numpy, pandas
- **APIs**: Spotify Web API
- **Web Framework**: Flask
- **Database**: SQLite
