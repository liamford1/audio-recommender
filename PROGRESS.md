### Week 1: Foundation & Core ML
**Goal**: Working notebook that recommends 10 similar songs given input

#### Day 1-2: Environment & Data
- [**X**] **Setup Complete** (Person: Liam)
  - [**X**] All development tools working
  - [**X**] FMA dataset loaded and verified (8,000 tracks)
  - [**X**] Basic audio processing pipeline tested

#### Day 3-4: Feature Extraction  
- [**X**] **Audio Embeddings** (Person: Liam)
  - [**X**] Pre-trained model (OpenL3) integrated
  - [**X**] Embedding extraction working on sample tracks
  - [**X**] Embeddings stored efficiently (6144-dimensional vectors)
  - [**X**] Database schema designed and created

#### Day 5-7: Basic Recommender
- [**X**] **Similarity Engine** (Person: Liam)
  - [**X**] Cosine similarity calculation implemented
  - [**X**] K-NN recommender built
  - [**X**] Basic evaluation framework created
  - [**X**] Manual testing on 15+ sample songs completed

**Week 1 Deliverable**: ✅ `01_data_exploration.ipynb` with working recommendations

#### Key Results Achieved:
- Successfully extracted OpenL3 embeddings for multiple songs
- Built functional similarity-based recommender
- Achieved 0.95+ similarity scores for related tracks
- Validated system distinguishes between different musical content
- Complete audio ML pipeline from raw MP3 → recommendations
